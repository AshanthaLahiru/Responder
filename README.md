# SERT

> A GitHub Integration built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot) that sets expectation for response time for contributors on creation of new issues.

## How does the response time generate?

Once a issue is created, average response time of the initial responses given by the contributors of the repository or the organization to previous issues is calculated.


## Setup

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) if you would like to run your own instance of this app.
